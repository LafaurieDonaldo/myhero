A character with an overwhelming past appears in this world, at first glance you’ll notice his bandages that cover the majority of his forehead and face; thus the name given 4head. Normally his bandages cover his forehead and part of the left side of his face, this is to hide what defines his anomaly ability on his eye. He eye as fierce as fire, as bright as the sun, yet his personality is calm. He’s a good character with good intentions, but good intentions with a dangerous power is difficult to manage. Misunderstood by many and targeted, he knows the consequences for what he is, you can get close to anyone who ends up affected. ( Yet in the story a few do and is what makes this story special).
