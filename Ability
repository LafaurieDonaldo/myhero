	<h1>4head's Ability</h1>
	<p> The character of 4Head is unique. After the events of The Day of Night the world began to have changes not just on the planet but on humans too. So after the rebuild of the new world, cases of people with power and children developing strange abilities began to emerge. Thatâ€™s the short story of it and where our character comes from. His power is spirit manifestation. A mysterious power that allows him to manifest a person he touches with an unusual side effect. 4Head begins to feel and live the story of the person he touches as his own. It causes an impact on his mind, triggering also his mysterious left side where if the person he touches has any dark emotion it activates. As long as he is in control he can release his ability at will but it's when he can't maintain control where the core of the story starts.
