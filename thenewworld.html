	<h1>The New World</h1>
	<p> In North East Island City finding music is rare. How can there be sounds in such a world that has experienced the unimaginable ? . There are few that remember the old world before the catastrophe of “The Day Of Night” but to hear any around not so much. A non ending fear of tomorrow is what lives in the minds of many. ( In the story however there are few that play music but that’s more in the story to be told, but in general the world is as quiet as you can imagine it to be.) An atmosphere of loss and fear what can one expect really. And thus I introduce our character, he lives in the city.  His mistakes of the past make him isolated, being an anomaly with such an appearance doesn't help him much either. Mornings are night, afternoons are bright with very little daylight. If time isn't monitored one couldn't really tell what time it is. Yet rain and cold is the one weather, summer is no more and seasons are just a part of history. The sound of silence with the beat of fear is the day by the day, loss and fear surrounding the atmosphere.
